<p><em>This Website will be to show the progress I have made and a little about myself</em></p>

<div class= firstP>
    <p>I finished my original education in around 2017 after finishing college with an OCR national diplpoma in computing,
    I then went into full time work, working such jobs in retail and admin before landing roles in call centres which was
    not originally what I wanted to do, after a time I got head hunted by a bank and worked in fixing ATM's remotely via remote terminals,
    this was great for a time and I was earning good money which allowed me to take out 6 months and travel the world which was eye opening 
    and a good time to reflect on where I was in my life, feeling like a stones throw in an ocean in the many companies I have worked for I now feel 
    a strong desire to learn and further my career options while doing something I <strong>enjoy!</strong> so here we are starting my journey into coding
     ! please follow along with this website as it mutates and morphs with my skills !</p1>
