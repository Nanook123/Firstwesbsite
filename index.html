    <div class=firstP>
        <p>I finished my original education in around 2017 after finishing college with an OCR national diplpoma in
            computing,
            I then went into full time work, working such jobs in retail and admin before landing roles in call centres
            which was
            not originally what I wanted to do, after a time I got head hunted by a bank and worked in fixing ATM's
            remotely via remote terminals,
            this was great for a time and I was earning good money which allowed me to take out 6 months and travel the
            world which was eye opening
            and a good time to reflect on where I was in my life, feeling like a stones throw in an ocean in the many
            companies I have worked for I now feel
            a strong desire to learn and further my career options while doing something I <strong>enjoy!</strong> so
            here we are starting my journey into coding
            ! please follow along with this website as it mutates and morphs with my skills !</p1>

        <p> From the above pics you can see I have found a love of travel, diving and food! I love to cook myself with
            some of my
            favorite dishes being jerk chicken, Katsu curry and making delecious bone broths for various broth based
            meals, I am also an avid gamer who has been playing games since I was 3 years old playing Donkey Kong
            country on snes, I now play alot of PC games with way too many hours in DOTA2.
